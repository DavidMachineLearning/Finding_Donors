# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML (Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree)
You can find more informations in my [Post](https://davidforino-aisolutions.com/finding-donors/).

# Project Overview

Apply supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

Explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded.

Apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format.

Evaluate several supervised learners on the data and consider which is best suited for the solution.

Optimize the selected model and present it as a solution to CharityML. 

Finally, explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see how well it's performing.
